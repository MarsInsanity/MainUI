/**
 * MainUI State API, version 1: lets MainUI (an Android frontend) save and load states in this
 * emulator directly, instead of pressing hotkeys it may not have.
 *
 * <p>MainUI sends an explicit broadcast {@link #ACTION_COMMAND} to this app with
 * {@link #EXTRA_COMMAND} "save", "load" or "status", a {@link #EXTRA_SLOT} (0-based; {@link
 * #RESUME_SLOT} is a separate state MainUI keeps for "continue where I left off", never one of the
 * user's slots), a {@link #EXTRA_REQUEST} id and {@link #EXTRA_REPLY_TO} (its package). The command
 * waits for the best moment ({@link #waitReady}): a game booted and running, not paused, not
 * loading, not in the emulator's own menu. It is carried out on a worker thread, and the answer
 * goes back as the broadcast {@link #ACTION_RESULT} to that package.
 *
 * <p>A launch intent with {@link #EXTRA_LOAD_SLOT} loads that slot once the game has booted and
 * settled ({@link #onLaunch}).
 *
 * <p>The emulator says it has the API with {@code <meta-data android:name="io.github.mainui.STATE_API"
 * android:value="1"/>} in its application, registers {@link Receiver} for {@link #ACTION_COMMAND},
 * and attaches an {@link Emulator} while a game runs.
 *
 * <p>This file is the same in every emulator; only the {@link Emulator} adapter differs.
